# Swar Mine 🎶🧠

**Swar Mine** is an AI-powered music intelligence tool designed to analyze and recognize Indian classical musical patterns, swars (notes), and bol (syllables). The project leverages Deep Learning for audio analysis, transcription, and pattern recognition in traditional musical forms such as Kathak bols, ghazals, and qawwalis.

## 🔍 Features
- Transcribes audio recordings of classical music/speech into text.
- Detects specific rhythmic patterns and swar variations.
- Supports Indian classical music elements like `Dha`, `Dhin`, `Na`, `TiRaKiTa`.
- Can be used as a learning and evaluation tool for performers and students.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Librosa
- TensorFlow/Keras
- NumPy, Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

## 🚀 Getting Started
